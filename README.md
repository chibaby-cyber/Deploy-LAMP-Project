# LAMP Stack Implementation AWS
In this project, I demonstrate the implementation of a LAMP stack project in AWS.                                                        

LAMP Stack is one of the various technology stacks that exist. A technology stack is a set of frameworks and tools used to develop a software product. This set of frameworks and tools are very specifically chosen to work together in creating a well-functioning software. They are acronymns for individual technologies used together for a specific technology product. LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP or Python, or Perl) is one of them. Others include; LEMP (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, PHP or Python, or Perl), MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS), MEAN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS)

To perform this project, I must carry out the following steps
- Create a EC2 Instance
- Install APACHE and Update the Firewall
- Install MYSQL
- Install PHP
- Create Virtual Host Using APACHE
- Enable PHP on the website

## Create a EC2 Instance
In order to complete this project you will need an AWS account and a virtual server with Ubuntu Server OS.

AWS is the biggest Cloud Service Provider and it offers a free tier account that we are going to leverage for our projects.
